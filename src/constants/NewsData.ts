                Completing this quest will uncover clues about the Fish King of

                for the hero can be recycled into Spiritstones, which can be

              <p className="text-left">
                <br />
                &nbsp;1. Lowering the difficulty of certain AFK Challenge
                stages. To minimize the impact of randomness on stage clearance
                and battle performance, we are significantly lowering the
                critical damage multiplier of enemies in some modes. This change
                does not affect enemies' crit rate or skill effects triggered by
                critical hits, nor does it alter your heroes' crit rate or
                critical damage multiplier.
                <br />
                This adjustment will apply to AFK Stages, Dream Realm, Dura's
                Trials, Ravaged Realm, and Primal Lord.

                &nbsp; 2. Skip battle option optimizations:
                <br />
                Adding the option to skip battles in Crystal Clash, Heroic
                Gauntlet, Relentless Rumble, Titan Reaver, and Arcane Labyrinth
                during combat.
                <br />
                Adding a pre-battle skip option in certain situations to Ravaged
                Realm, Guild Supremacy, and Battle Drills, as well as for the
                2nd battle of each day in Dream Realm and Primal Lord. This
                allows you to skip the fight during battle preparation and go
                straight to the results.
                <br />
                Adding a skip stage option for AFK Stages, Legend Trial, and
                Trial of Abyss when your Hands of Resonance heroes vastly
                outpower the enemies, letting you jump directly to a stage that
                matches your Power level.
